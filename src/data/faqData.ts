    question: "What's the difference between a course, specialization, and professional certificate?",
    answer: "A course is a single learning program focused on a specific topic (4-6 weeks). A specialization is a series of related courses (3-7 typically) that build deeper expertise in a subject area (3-6 months). A professional certificate is designed specifically for job preparation and career advancement, consisting of multiple courses focused on industry-relevant skills (3-9 months). While all offer certificates, professional certificates are most directly aligned with specific career outcomes."
